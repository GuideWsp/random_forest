<h3> Random Forests </h3>

**This is forked from the Stochastic_Bosque code from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31036-random-forest

**They claim that the code is licenced but it is irrational to have proprietary malfunctioning code :) Therefore I make it working and release as open-source.

** This is really efficient code based on low level <b>cart tree</b> implementation on C++.

** However original code has some functioning flows. These are checked and add some additional features with additional performance boosts.

** If you have a matlab distribution including parallel processing toolbox you might try to use <b>parfor</b> instead of for at the random_forests.m

** To learn the usage refer to the test.m and before the use of test.m you need to run config.m to inlude the library to path.

** If you have any question:
